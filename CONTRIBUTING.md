## Guidelines for Contributions

### Issues
- When opening a new issue, ensure that the problem is clearly described. Use one of the following tags:
  - `bug`: For reporting issues or bugs.
  - `enhancement`: For suggesting new features.
  - `documentation`: For improving documentation.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
- Ensure your PR addresses only **one** issue or feature. This makes it easier for us to review.
- Reference the issue number your PR is solving in the description (e.g., `Fixes #15`).
- Add detailed descriptions to explain what the PR does.
- Ensure that your code is well-commented and follows coding standards.
- If you're adding a new feature, make sure to include unit tests.
